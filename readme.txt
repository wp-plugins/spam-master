Spam Master is the Ultimate Spam Protection plugin that blocks new user registrations and post comments with Real Time anti-spam lists.


== Description ==

Spam Master was born out of need to protect our website against constant malicious spam registrations and comments that affect the majority of wordpress websites. We did it the TechGasp way... coded a brand new, clean and fast plugin that will make your professional wordpress website safe and clean.

Spam Master protects Wordpress based websites from thousands of know spam emails, domains, ip's and words by blocking user registrations or post comments. Uses RBL technology (real time block lists) constantly being updated.

The problem facing spam targeted wordpress blogs is that most of the spam registrations or comments are done by a mixture of "bots" robots and human spamming. Most of the spam registration systems fail including captcha precisely because the human factor kicks in during registration, also these captcha systems "push away" real user registrations and can injure your professional, commercial, sales based website income.

The plugin comes packed with automated Spam Learning function that will make your wordpress blog a fighting spam enforcer by providing registration ip's and emails for analysis and spam lists inclusion.

Very few plugins will actually show the statistics we packed into spam master. Selected Protection Level, Total Website Users, Total Spam Blocked, Total Number of Threats you are Protected from, Spam Learning, Status of RBL Spam Servers, and a list of the last 5 users registrations with (user id, registration date, user status, name, username, and email).
